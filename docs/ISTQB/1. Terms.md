##### Errors - Defects - Failures & Root Causes

##### 7 testing principles
- Testing shows the presence, not the absence of defects -> *Reduce the bugs, but can't promise there is no bug.*
- Exhaustive testing is impossible -> *Can't test every possible pathway, Have to use test techniques. *
- Early testing saves time and money -> *Shift left*
- Defects cluster together
- *Tests wear out* -> Same tests are repeated many times, should modify or add new test data. Or automate. 
- Testing is context dependent -> *It's done differently in diff context*
- Absence of defects fallacy -> *No error, but doesn't achieve business goals. *

##### Test basis vs Testware
*Basis - Input before testing* 
- RSD
- Figma
- User Stories
- Business Rules
- Source code

*Testware - Output of Test activities (After receiving Basis) -> Define what & how to test*
- Test plan, schedule
- Testcases
- Test scripts
- Test data
- Test reports

##### TDD - ATDD - BDD (Ch 2)
##### Test Level
- Component / Unit Testing (Local / Dev)
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
	- Functional
	- Non-functional
- System Integration Testing (SIT)
- Acceptance Testing (UAT)

##### Test Types
- Functional
- Non-functional
- Black-box
- White-box

##### Severity vs Priority
*Severity = How bad of the impact* (Technical or Functional impact)
- Critical
- Major
- Moderate
- Minor
*Priority = Urgency to fix* (Business urgency)
- High
- Medium
- Low

##### Confirmation vs Regression
- ***Confirmation***: re-test when previously failed or fixed bug or new change
- ***Regression***: after confirmation -> should apply automation

##### Static vs Dynamic Testing (Ch 3)
#### Black-box
###### EP (Equivalent Partitioning)
###### BVA
###### Decision Table
###### State transition
#### White-box
###### Statement Testing
###### Branch Testing
###### Others
- MC/DC
- Multi condition
- Loop
- Basic Path

#### Experience-based
###### Error Guessing
###### Exploratory

#### Entry vs Exit Criteria

| Entry                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Exit                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DoR (Definition of Ready)<br>Pre condition before testing include:<br>- Req, Env, user stories<br>- Tools<br>- Test data<br><br>-> If entry criteria doesn't meet<br>Then it's very hard to start testing | DoD (Definition of Done)<br>Included:<br>- % execution of testcases<br>- Achieve ?% of coverage<br>- Budget<br>- Run out of Time |
